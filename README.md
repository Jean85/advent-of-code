# advent-of-code
My attempts at solving http://adventofcode.com using PHP

To use this repository, you can simply request a solution from the CLI:

```
$ php solve.php 4                                                       
Solution for day 4

325

Second part of the solution for day 4

119
```

Each solution class has the input as the only constructor argument, and it defaults to my values.
